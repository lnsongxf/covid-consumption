This is repository for a **preliminary project** on the Consumption Response to Covid-19 Pandemic and Policy Interventions. The core of the project is the use the IHS-Polk auto registration data as a measure of durable consumption and study how it responded to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated policy interventions. IHS-Polk auto registration data provides the near universe of auto purchases in the US by county, by month. This provides a unique look into high-stakes, forward looking purchases, that can be easily mapped to aggregate statistics (NIPA).
